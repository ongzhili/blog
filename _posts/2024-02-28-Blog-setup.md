## Set-up a personal blog!

I figured it was about time to start tinkering around and getting a blog going to keep track of my work.

I opted to use minimal-mistakes as:
- It looked good 
- Works out of the box (after installing Ruby and stuff)
- Allowed me to refine my markdown writing as each post can be (and would be) written in .md format.
- In the future, after I learn html, I could use that too.
