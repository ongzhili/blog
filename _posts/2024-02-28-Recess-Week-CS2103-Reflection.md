## Preface
CS2103 is the introductory Software Engineering module taught in NUS, where we work on over the semester to learn software development principles and practices.

It has 2 main projects
- iP (Individual Project)
- tP (Team Project)

### iP: Individual Project

#### Preface

Here, we are tasked to create a ToDo list program, starting from scratch, simulating a greenfield project.

Every week, we are tasked to do up some extra features for our to-do list, and eventually, a basic GUI as well.

And by recess week, (end of week 6), we were to have a finalized working release to be graded. So essentially, most of the work for the module at the first half of the semester would be the iP.

#### Reflection

Biggest takeaway from the iP was familiarizing with source control in my opinion. Probably the most important as well, as this is one of the key skills a SWE should possess in his/her toolkit.

### tP: Team Project

#### Preface

We are given a working program and essentially, we have to add features to it, simulating a brownfield project software development process.

Currently, we have basically only set-up the repository and did some codebase familiarization, and the next couple of weeks, we will be working on them.

#### Reflection

Brainstorming is hard! Thinking of ideas is easy, but thinking with feasibility in consideration is challenging in the sense that, after pooling our ideas, picking out the viable ones is the biggest challenge.
